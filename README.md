# GlobalEnergy

## Introduction
Every day, our species chews its way through more than a million terajoules of energy. That’s roughly equivalent to what we would use if all 7.5 billion of us boiled 70 kettles of water an hour around the clock. Or 3,000 times the daily output of Palo Verde nuclear power station in Arizona – one of the world’s largest – running at full capacity. With the global population swelling and industrialization on the rise in developing nations, humanity’s hunger for energy has reached unprecedented levels. Therefore, it could be a good approach that visually present our nowadays’ energy production and consumption condition to help people better learn about our current condition.
