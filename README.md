# Analysis of Global Energy with Data Visualization

## Introduction
Every day, our species chews its way through more than a million terajoules of energy. That’s roughly equivalent to what we would use if all 7.5 billion of us boiled 70 kettles of water an hour around the clock. Or 3,000 times the daily output of Palo Verde nuclear power station in Arizona – one of the world’s largest – running at full capacity. With the global population swelling and industrialization on the rise in developing nations, humanity’s hunger for energy has reached unprecedented levels. Therefore, it could be a good approach that visually present our nowadays’ energy production and consumption condition to help people better learn about our current condition. 

## Objective
This project is aimed to realize insights about energy issues with data visualization. Make a use of various tools and advanced techniques to create an excellent visualization which is able to communicate information clearly and efficiently to the end users. In the end it will be displayed on a dynamic website which can be easily navigated and understood.

## Code
The code folder contains all HTML files that corresponding to the homepage and subpages. All HTML files share one cascading style sheets named ‘style_energy.css’.  Images used as illustration are included in the ‘img’ folder. The following are brief descriptions of files included in code folder.

#### Homepage:
home.html

#### Subpage of energy overview:
coal.htm
electricity.html
naturalGas.html
oilProducts.html
renewables.html
totalEnergy.html

#### Subpage of CO2 emission:
emission.html

#### Subpage of contact: 
contact.html

#### Cascading style sheet:
style_energy.css

#### eChart library:
echarts.js

## Dataset
The original datasets are pretty large and each dataset consists of information about 60 countries over 27 years. To make the analysis more niche-targeting, the countries selected are narrowed down to United States, Sauid Arabia, Russia, Canada, Iran, China, Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia. The cleaned data is directly addressed in the HTML files. 

## Presentation
Presentation folder contains two files: PowerPoint and a YouTube link to the presentation video. The video is a general analysis of each energy source according to the visualized data. 

## Technical Report
This report provides an overview of functional requirements to set up and compile the HTML files. Also, it introduces the system architecture and development platforms used in this project. In addition, the proposed visualizations are described in details. In the end, you can also find useful tips of how to start an interactive web design and complex data visualizations.
